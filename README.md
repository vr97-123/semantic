#### About the program:
-----------------------
This Python program demonstrates the usage of the spaCy module to compare word similarity using different models. 

Two pre-trained models, "en_core_web_md" and "en_core_web_sm," are loaded, and three words, "cat," "monkey," and "banana," are analysed in the first and second examples using the models, and their similarity rates are printed. 

The third example uses for loops to compare similarity between words in a sentence. 

The fourth example compares similarity scores between "car", "bike", "book", and "chair" using the "en_core_web_md" model. 

The program highlights that while for loops can calculate similarity, they may not align with human intuition due to basic word embeddings, and the spaCy models provide more contextual information, accounting for meanings and sentence relationships.
